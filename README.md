## MindEase AI - Your AI Pocket Companion for Your Mental Well-being

## Hackathon Details :
This Project is made for Hack4Health hackathon Submission.

## üå± Inspiration

With the growing awareness around mental health, we noticed a gap in accessible, judgment-free tools for everyday emotional support. Not everyone feels comfortable seeking therapy, and many prefer a private space to process emotions. That insight led to the birth of **MindEase** ‚Äî an AI-powered companion that encourages self-reflection, calming techniques, and emotional tracking, all in one place.

## üí° What it does

**MindEase** is a web-based application that helps users:
- Reflect on their emotions through guided check-ins  
- Receive AI-generated calming messages based on their feelings  
- Access quick relaxation exercises like breathing and journaling prompts  
- Track emotional trends over time using visual charts  
- Explore self-care suggestions personalized to their mood

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

- React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a soft orange-beige calming palette
- LocalStorage for emotion tracking and persistence
- Google Gemini API for AI-powered empathetic guidance and affirmations, with robust fallback   responses based on mood detection
